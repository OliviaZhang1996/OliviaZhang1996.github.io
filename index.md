## About Me

I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate specializing in robotics and computer vision, under the supervision of <a href="https://shiyuzhao.westlake.edu.cn"><autocolor> Prof. Shiyu Zhao</autocolor></a>. I also worked with <a href="https://ethliup.github.io"><autocolor> Prof. Peidong Liu </autocolor></a> and <a href="https://wenli-vision.github.io"><autocolor> Prof. Wen Li</autocolor></a>. Before my doctoral studies, I earned a Bachelor's degree from Tianjin University (2017) and a Master's degree from Beihang University (2020). I am passionate about advancing intelligent systems for real-world applications. I am actively seeking postdoctoral opportunities to apply my skills and contribute to innovative teams in robotics, AI, or related fields.
